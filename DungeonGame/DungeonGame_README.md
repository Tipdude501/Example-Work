"dungeon_game.py" is a program I wrote in 2015 for a school assignment. 
The goal was to create a simple procedural game consisting of a player, an enemy, and a goal/escape.

The assignment was broken up into segments:
 * create a cell grid using a list
 * have a player, enemy, and exit spawn in random cells
 * enable the user to move
 * have the player lose if they enter the enemy's cell
 * have the player win if they enter the exit cell
 
I added a couple extra things:
  * bumping into walls
  * printing out the grid so the user can see it
  * optimized inputs so they weren't case sensitive
  * made it so that the player, enemy, and exit couldn't spawn in the same place
